# Egwu: A Nigerian State Word Game

"Egwu" means game in Igbo. The Egwu project is a word game where the user has to guess the correct Nigerian state after its letters have been jumbled. 

This game was created largely to teach my daughter about her history, but it could also be used by teachers or parents to help students learn about the states in Nigeria and interesting facts in a fun way. This journey led me to study the history of Nigerian states and uncover some interesting facts.

# How to Play

The rule of the game is for the player to correctly guess the Nigerian state name that is jumbled up. Once guessed correctly, the user will see additional information about the state, including the capital and interesting facts. 

As you play and learn, your score is tallied and stored locally, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project extends beyond creating just another word game. The Egwu game is designed to be educational, providing insights into the Nigerian states and their history. This makes it a valuable tool for anyone seeking to learn about Nigeria's history, culture, and geography in an interactive and engaging manner.

# Installation
